# Preliminary data analysis {#data-prelim}
_NOTE: need to mention throught this chapter where and why the preliminary analysis links to the methods_

This chapter explores our dataset for the purpose of ascertaining any patterns and attributes that may assist in our predictive modelling. It starts by explaining the cleaning and preperation process, then uses methods to compare and visualise cycles and correllations within relevant variables. The analysis draws upon a broader overview of the data available at https://cfsotago.github.io/GREENGridData/.

## Initial data cleaning
Some of the houses in the original dataset are not suited to this analysis. Three houses were removed immediately (`rf_15`, `rf_17` and `rf_46`) due to issues with the data collection process (see https://github.com/CfSOtago/GREENGridData/issues/21 and https://github.com/CfSOtago/GREENGridData/issues/19 for more information). 
Households `rf_07`, `rf_09`, `rf_10`, `rf_17b`, `rf_19`, `rf_21`, `rf_26`, `rf_28`, `rf_41`, `rf_43`, `rf_47` did not have seperate hot water metering, and household `rf_23` had hot water controlled by a home energy management system. These households are therefore also unsuitable for this analysis and were removed. 

Data files from the remaining households are unzipped and processed using the `GREENGridData` package \@ref(R-GREENGridData). Total electricity is imputed from the submeters using the script `imputeTotalPower.R` (obtained from the `GREENGridData` github repository). From this output, we extract imputed total electricity demand and hot water electricity demand using `GREENGridData::extractCircuitFromCleanGridSpy1min.R`. The outputs from this script then require some further cleaning and processing to be suitable for our analysis.

The remaining 32 households were combined into one data table. Hot water electricity is then subtracted from total electricity, giving hot water electricity, and other electricity. 
Due to some anomolies in the first occurrences of data collection for some houses a start date of 01/07/15 was chosen for all households, with data before this period discarded.
As much analysis would be carried out for "half hour" data, another datatable was constructed which took averages of the one minute electricity values over each half hour. 

Refer to the script `processing.R` (see appendix) to view the processing code.

# Choose which househould we want to examine

#house <- "13" 
mins <- "1"  

# Daily and weekly cycles created from mins

if (as.numeric(mins) == 1) {
  dayCycle <- 60*24
  weekCycle <- 60*24*7
  linearLag <- -30
  hourCorrection <- 60
  dtName <- "DT"
} else if (as.numeric(mins) == 30) {
  dayCycle <- 2*24
  weekCycle <- 2*24*7
  linearLag <- -1
  hourCorrection <- 2
  dtName <- "DTqh"
} else {
    print("Check minute sample rate (only 1 and 30 currently available)")
}

load(paste0(dFile, dtName, ".Rda"))


```

## Data summary

See Table \@ref{tab:summary1} for the mean values of hot water electricity and other electricity for each household.
```{r summary1}
DT %>%
  group_by(linkID) %>%
  select(-c(r_dateTime, dateTime_nz)) %>%
  summarise_each(funs = mean)
```
Note that household 24 has a negative mean non-hot water electricity. This is due to the presence of solar PV. 
A full list of houses that have solar PV is given in `PV_houses.Rda`. _It is not known at this stage whether these negative values will effect our analysis, but we do not remove houses with PV at this stage._

## Autocovariance of hot water use

We would expect hot water electricity use to be somewhat cyclic, with daily and weekly periodicity due to the routines of the household occupants. These cycles are explored using two separate methods. The first is autocovariance. Autocovariance compares the covariance of a stochastic process (such as our time series data of hot water electricity use) with itself at different time steps. This is a valuable tool for visualising cyclical behaviour of data, and is defined as

\begin{equation}
\gamma_k = E[(x_t - \mu)(x_{t+k} - \mu)]
\end{equation}
where $k$ is the lag value and $\mu$ is the mean of both $x_t$ and $x_{t+k}$.
<!--
![Autocovariance of all houses.](~/HWCanalysis/Masters/plots/acf_all_houses.png)
-->

```{r autocovariance, out.width='100%', fig.cap="Autocovariance of all households"}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(pFile, "acfAllHouses.pdf"))
```

The results are interpreted by plotting $\gamma_k$ against the lag values. Figure \@ref(fig:autocovariance) indicates that our houses are strongly cyclic, with peaks in demand occurring on approximately daily (1440 minute) and 12-hourly (720 minute) intervals. In addition, some houses display a third daily cycle, or a weekly cycle (peaks increasing again towards the end of the plot). 
Household `rf_24` displays strong daily anticorrellations. _Currently unsure as to why this is. Household 23 apparently has a HEMS but not 24_

While autocovariance plots are valuable for preliminary data analysis, models that incorporate these cycles need more precise numerical values of these cycles. One method of obtaining usable cycle periods is through frequency analysis.

```{r frequencyAnalysis, out.width='100%',fig.cap = "Three dominant cycle periods for each household, as determined using frequency analysis"}
load(file=paste0(dFile, "freq_DF.Rda"))
knitr::kable(freq_DF, 
      col.names = c("Household", "Dominance", "Frequency (hours)"))
```


Frequency analysis offers us the ability to automate the process of determining cycles in our data. Through the TSA package 'periodogram' we can extract the most dominant cycle frequencies within our data. These may then be input into later models that have the option of seasonality.  _Do I need to describe technique this package uses to do this? Should I include the periodogram (plot) itself?_

Table \@ref(tab:frequencyAnalysis) shows that while some houses have "expected" cycle values (12 hour, 24 hour, 7 day) many have more erratic patterns, with some being over a year in duration. This is an interesting insight, however it poses a challenge for building "one size fits all" predictive models for our households.

## Cross covarience of hot water electricity use with non hot water electricity use

In a similar fashion to the autocovariance function, the cross-covariance function of two variables $x, y$ is given by

\begin{equation}
\gamma_k(x,y) = \operatorname{E}[(x_{t+k} - \mu_x)(y_t - \mu_y)]
\end{equation}
where variable $x$ lags variable $y$ by lag $k$[@Cowpertwait2009].

Plotting the cross-covarience (known as a _cross correlogram_) allows visual inspection of the relation between the two variables at different time lags. Figure \@ref(fig:crossCovariance) shows that our hot water electricity use is positively correlated with other electricity use at lags of around half an hour.

```{r crossCovariance, out.width='100%', fig.cap="Crosscovariance of all households"}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(pFile, "ccfAllHouses.pdf"))
```

## Seasonality

One reason why linear prediction models fail with our electricity data is due to the cyclical nature of residential electricity usage (referred to as 'seasonality'). There are a number of methods we use to explore any cyclical effects or trends of time series data. One of these is STL decomposition. STL is an acronym for 'Seasonal and Trend decomposition using loess', whereby loess (short for Local regression) is a method for estimating nonlinear relationships. The STL method was developed by Cleveland, Cleveland, McRae, & Terpenning (1990).
_Expand on method?_

```{r stl, include = FALSE, eval=FALSE}
# Needs editing to work with DT

#df$times <- as.POSIXct(df$times) # may not be necessary if set up correctly
ts.HW <- ts(dt$HWelec, frequency = 48)
#ts.HW <- ts(dt$HWelec, frequency = 48*7)
decomp.HW <- decompose(ts.HW)
plot(decomp.HW)
```

```{r stl_gg, include = FALSE, eval=FALSE}

#df_xts <- as.xts(df) 
#frequency(dt$HWelec) <- time3[1]

#stat_stl(ts.HW, s.window = "Periodic")
HWstl <-  stl(ts.HW, s.window = "periodic")
#plot(HWstl)
######

s_df <- tsdf(ts.HW)
ggplot(ap_df, aes(x = x, y = y)) +
   stat_stl(s.window = 60)

# periodic if fixed seasonality; doesn't work well:
ggplot(dt, aes(x = datetime, y = HWelec)) +
   stat_stl(s.window = "Periodic")

      method = "stl", s.window = 7) +
   geom_line() +
   labs(x = "   n  ", colour = "") +
   scale_y_continuous("Power(W)", label = comma) +
   ggtitle("Seasonal decomposition of electricity demand") +
   theme(legend.position = c(0.17, 0.92))

   grid.text("Source: Statistics New Zealand, Balance of Payments", 0.7, 0.03,
          gp = gpar(fontfamily = "myfont", fontface = "italic", cex = 0.7))

```

_This is a great package that seperates out the cycle, trend, and noise, and plots them. Needs some work to run nicely_
