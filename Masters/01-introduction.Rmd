## Demand side management
_This needs to be longer, and paint a clear picture of the 'problem' I am trying to solve_

Temporal variation in electricity demand occurs at a variety of timescales in an electricity grid. As electrical energy cannot be stored, electricity supply must match this fluctuating demand, requiring underutilised generation and transmission infrastructure to be available on demand, a costly and inefficient situation[@Strbac2008]. 
_Periods of high demand are referred to as 'peaks'. In New Zealand, every additional kW of peak demand is estimated to require up to \$200/year in additional infrastructure costs[@Jack]. Consider removing this, it doesn't flow nicely._
There are currently a range of mechanisms in place to ensure that the supply of electricity balances with the varying demand[@Strbac2008], and that currents do not exceed transmission and distribution infrastructure constraints[@TranspowerNZ2015].
The degree to which electricity generation and electricity load is in balance is given by the frequency of the alternating current.
In New Zealand, demand and supply are in balance when the frequency measures 50Hz. 
If the frequency becomes greater than 50Hz, electricity generation must decrease or load increase. Conversely, if the frequency drops below 50Hz, generation must increase or load must decrease[@EANZ2014].
The ability to rapidy increase generation or decrease load is therefore of value to the network, and this is reflected by the ability to sell these frequency-correcting capacities in a national 'instantaneous reserves' (IR) market.
Electricity generators that are running under capacity, and electricity consumers with a large enough load, may sell their ability to increase supply or decrease demand in half-hour ahead markets.
These actors are then paid for this service, regardless of whether or not they were required to perform it.

An additional mechanism for matching supply and demand is that of spot market electricity pricing.
The New Zealand electricity grid is composed of over 200 points at which electricity may enter or exit. These are referred to as the grid 'nodes'. 
Electricity generators bid for the right to provide electricity to cover the predicted demand of each grid node over the next half-hour[@ElectricityAuthority2011]. 
Price variation occurs according to supply and demand. Prices rise when there is high electricity demand on the grid or there is limited availability of electricity resources with low marginal cost of production, such as those from renewable sources. Conversely, prices fall when electricity is cheap to produce, or total electricity demand is low. 
Spot market electricity prices fluctuate wildly, with the Benmore node BEN2201 having prices ranging from \$0.02/MWh to \$894.38/MWh during 2017.
Electricity retailers purchase electricity from the generators on this spot market, and sell it to consumers. Electricity consumers are usually charged a fixed price per kWh, with the price variability being 'bundled in' by the retailer.
There have been proposals[@NewZealandElectricityCommission2009] that a market-based tactic to reduce grid peaks would be to encourage residential consumers to move to a real-time pricing plan that uses smart meters to send price signals in order to disincentivise peak-time electricity usage. 
Electricity company Flick in New Zealand is already providing this, offering customers with compatible smart-meters the spot-market electricity price (with additional base costs). An app that displays the current spot price is provided to customers, with the intention being that consumers attempt to reduce demand during times of comparatively high prices.
While this method of 'deliberate' demand response is well intentioned, studies of consumer response to changes in electricity price indicate that prices generally have little effect on consumption patterns when relying on consumers to deliberately alter their electricity consumption[@Lawson2011a; @Okajima2013; @Filippini2011].
One solution is to automate the scheduling of appliances in order to take advantage of price differentials. 
Many electricity using devices can have their use times shifted on a daily scale with limited impact to the end user (a property referred to as 'flexibility'). Devices such as washing machines and dishwashers exhibit this property, along with battery storage systems in the form of electric cars and bicycles, and some thermostatically controlled appliances such as the focus of this thesis, electric hot water cylinders (HWCs). Flexibile devices are obvious candidates for autonomous control objectives, as they have significant potential to temporally shift their demand (for example into times where electricity is cheaper) with minimal impact to the end user.

The process of adjusting demand to meet supply is referred to as demand side management (DSM). The challenges associated with supplying electricity in order to effectively meet demand are likely to be exacerbated by the predicted increase of renewable energy in the grid, as renewable energy generation is often reliant on weather conditions, and consequently can not easily be shifted to meet demand[@Lund2015]. Demand side management is thus likely to have an increasing role in the transition to a low-carbon electricity grid. 
With the rapid rise of 'internet of things' technology, whereby devices are interconnected and offer the ability to be controlled remotely, there is the ability to remotely and autonomously schedule flexible devices in order to minimise operations costs or more effectively utilise renewable electricity sources.
Remote scheduling and load interruption already occurs to an extent in New Zealand, albeit in a rather crude fashion, though a process called ripple control.
Ripple control is a system whereby electricity distribution networks provide a discounted electricity rate in order to be able to cease the supply of electricity during peak periods or grid emergencies[@Orion2017]. 
This is achieved through sending high frequency signals though the electricity lines to be interpreted by specialised receivers that then suppress the operation of the appliance they are connected to (usually hot water cylinders or irrigation systems).
While this system as it currently operates is highly beneficial to the grid, it has been operating essentially unchanged since its introduction in the 1950s, and there is significant room for improvement utilising more recent technology[@Jack].
With the roll-out of smart meters in New Zealand, there is now the ability to collect and process essentially 'real-time' data on hot water electricity consumption. 
This would allow ripple control to be personalised to individual household useage patterns, providing the ability to suppress the element operation more or less frequently according to whether the household had low or high hot water consumption, respectively.

In addition to assisting DSM objectives, personalised control of hot water cylinders can improve their efficiency by only heating as much water as is required by the household. 
As hot water loses heat energy to the environment faster than cooler water, storing hot water in excess of what is required is an inefficiency. Simulations by Denis, Suard, Lomet and Chèze[@Denis2019] demonstrated avergage energy savings of up to 10% in hot water systems that only heated according to what was required.

## Why predict hot water electricity demand

The ability to predict usage patterns allows hot water cylinder elements to be controlled according to the usage patterns of individual houses. This is beneficial for demand side management objectives[@Gelazanskas2015], and can also facilitate improvements in energy efficiency[@Denis2019.

### Enhancing control for DSM objectives

Residential electricity demand is a key contributor to network demand peaks.
In New Zealand, it is estimated that residential electricity usage contributes around half of peak demand[@ElectricityCommission2007] and residential hot water use is around 30% of residential energy used[@Pollard2002]. 
A study by the Household Energy End Use Project (HEEP) showed that hot water usage makes up to 36% of residential peak demand[@Pollard2002], with other research suggesting it may be up to 50%[@Jack]. 
In New Zealand, electric hot water cylinders (HWCs) are very common, with 91% of households having electricity as an energy source for water heating[@Pollard2002]. 
Due to their ability to store and retain up to 10kWh of energy in the form of heat, hot water cylinders are generally the most “flexible” appliances in New Zealand households[@Stephenson2017], rendering them perfect candidates for demand shifting.
While control of hot water cylinders for DSM objectives is possible without demand forecasting, the ability to accurately predict future demand allows more finely-tuned control that may be catered to the use patterns of individual households, allowing a far greater range of control without negative effects to the end-user[@Lomet2015].
In addition, the ability to predict (with reasonable accuracy) the electricity load for the next half hour of a significant number of hot water cylinders would allow an aggregator service with remote control abilities to submit bids into the instantaneous reserves markets.

### Reducing standing losses

An additional benefit of hot water demand forecasting is that of reducing thermal losses[@Denis2019]. 
Hot water cylinders under normal usage conditions have a tendency to 'stratify' their contents into distict bodies of water, namely a hot upper layer of water and a cool lower layer of water, separated by a thin thermocline[@JackDew2018].
The household residents may use hot water with no noticeable changes in temperature until the hotter top layer suddenly runs out, causing the unpleasant 'cold water event', familar to many who have lived in a household with heavy hot water use.
For those households with moderate to low hot water demand however, their hot water cylinder may be keeping a far greater amount of water hot than they would expect to use.
As no insulation is perfect, any object that is hotter than its surroundings will suffer from heat loss, with the amount of heat lost being proportional to the difference in temperature between the body and the surroundings. 
Thus, all else being held equal, a warmer body loses more energy to it's surroundings than a cooler one.
For this reason, the ability to store only as much hot water as will be required by the household (with the remainder of the tank being left as cooler water) has the potential to significantly reduce hot water electricity consumption[@Denis2019]. 

## Forecasting overview

_Time series_ data is that which involves measurements of variables sequentially or at fixed intervals of time[@Cowpertwait2009].
This data may then be processed, analysed and extrapolated in a manner that produces predictions of future events or occurrences, a process known as 'forecasting'. 
There are number of different methods of forecasting time series data.
Although the distinction is subtle, these methods may be broadly separated into two catagories; (i) conventional, and (ii) artificial intelligence (AI)[@MatDaut2017].
Forecasting may also be boradly classified by the length of time into the future the forecast is predicting[@Ahmad2014]. Short term load forecasting (STLF) is usually used to refer to predictions of less than 24 hours, although it can refer to forecast periods of up to one week. Medium term load forecasting (MTLF) refers to predictions between one week and one year. Long term load forecasting (LTLF) is for predictions spanning longer than one year.

### Conventional forecasting methods

_Need to provide a clearer picture of the strengths and weaknesses of these forecasting methods_

Conventional methods may again be separated into two distinct techniques.
The first, referred to as _causal_ modelling[@Hong2016], utilises data of separate but related (explanatory[^1]) variables and makes predictions based on basic statistical relationships between them. Regression analysis is a causal model commonly used in electricity forecasting, and may be understood as follows:
If there is the ability to know (or sufficiently accurately predict) the value(s) of the independant variable(s) at a particular future time, then a forecast for the dependent variable may be calculated at that same time based on the causal relationship between them.
In the context of electricity demand forecasting, relevant predictable independent variables may be social factors such as public holidays, or (accurately forecasted) weather conditions[@Wei2018].
However if there is no obtainable value(s) for the independent variable(s) at the future time for which a prediction is required, more subtle techniques must be employed. 
One option is to establish a relationship between the value(s) of the independent variables and the following values of the dependent variable. In the context of DHW electricity demand forecasting, this may be the relationship between the electricity demand of other appliances, and subsequent values of DHW electricity demand.

Another conventional forecasting method known as _time series analysis_ utilises the fundamental properties of only the time series data of the variable being predicted.
On important technique used in time series analysis is the separation of the data into individual components, namely trend, cycles and 'noise'. 
In the context of DHW electricity time series data, the trend would be a gradual increase (or decrease) in average hot water use over long periods of time, the cycles would be average daily use patterns such as morning and evening peaks previously mentioned, and the noise is any deviation of the data from the trend and cycle components (people not actually using hot water according to strict mathematical relationships).
Additionally, forecasts may be made by understanding the relationships between a variable and its previous values. Autoregression (AR) and moving average (MA) are two commonly utilised techniques to obtain these relationships. In the context of DHW forecasting this method may be best interpreted as an understanding of the lengths of time a water heater element will typically remain on (or off) for. 

[^1]: Multivariate data can be thought to be made up of both dependent and independent (or 'explanatory') variables. Broadly speaking, dependent variables are those we are interested in measuring or predicting (in this research, hot water electricity demand). Explanatory variables are those we expect to impact our dependent variables (in this research we use time and the electricity demand of other appliances).

### AI forecasting methods

```{r ANNinDF, out.width='100%', fig.cap="Documents in SCOPUS containing keywords: artificial neural network electricity demand forecasting"}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(pFile, "artificial_neural_network_electricity_demand_forecasting.png"))
```


Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods are those that use more complex techniques from the field of machine learning for forecasting.
These methods can be considered separate from their conventional counterparts by their ability to process and establish relationships between data in a more autonomous fashion. 
In general, AI methods rely more on algorithms and large amounts of computational power than conventional forecasting methods, while conventional methods rely more on human intuition and statistics than AI methods.
Two commonly used AI techniques in the field of electricity demand forecasting are those of artificial neural networks (ANN) and support vector machines (SVM).

_Consider moving much of this section (below here) to methodology_

ANNs attempt to mimic biological learning mechanisms by processing a set of training data through clusters of artificial neurons, each of which individually recieve (numerical) inputs, assign them certain weights, and then output the weighted value into other artificial neurons, which perform the same task, until eventually producing a final output.
The weights assigned by each neuron are then iteratively adjusted in order to minimise the error of the final output.

While Hippert, Pedreira, and Souza[@Hippert2014] state in 2001 that ANNs do not outperform conventional forecasting methods in accuracy, a more recent analysis from Raza and Khosravi[@Raza2015] in 2015 claims the contrary.
Despite this recent claim to superiority in forecast accuracy, the computational expense of training ANNs can be a hindrance to large-scale adoption, as it generally involves a time-consuming process using expensive and energy-intensive computers.
While still an active research area, Figure \@ref(fig:ANNinDF) indicates that research in ANNs for electricity demand forecasting may have peaked, and now be diminishing.
This may be due to increasing interest in an alternative AI forecasting method for electricity demand forecasting, that of support vector machines (SVMs).
Support vector machines classify data points by mapping them in hyperspace and distinguising between them according to which side of a hyperplane they fall on, with the position of the classifying hyperplanes being constructed iteratively in order to maximise the perpendicular distance between each hyperplane and the closest samples on either side of it (refer to Figure \@ref(fig:SVMexample). Non-linear partitions can also be constructed using a kernel function.
Support vector machines may be used in electricity forecasting by automating the process of discovering, catagorising and quantifying various relationships within the data, such as those previously described as part of time series analysis and causal modelling[@Wei2018].
This method is less computationally expensive to train than ANNs, and better suited to solving non-linear problems such as those encountered in cyclic time series data[@Ahmad2014]. Perhaps for these reasons, research interest of SVMs in the context of electricity demand forecasting is still growing, as can be seen in Figure \@ref(fig:SVMinDF).

_Consider replacing these SCOPUS charts with a more broad search term relevent to my topic_

### Model selection

Every forecasting method has unique strengths and weaknesses that render it more or less suitable to different applications.
In the context of forecasting residential hot water electricity demand, there are a number of considerations that have led to some models being selected for further investigation, while others are passed over without consideration.
This work attempts to make predictions based only on data that would be available from any smart meter with a separately metered hot water cylinder, as is commonly available in New Zealand today. For this reason, causal models that rely on the availability of external data are not investigated further.
As this work is concerned mainly with making predictions only half an hour into the future, time series methods that attempt to uncover longer-term trends in averages are also not relevant.
Throughout this process I have placed strong emphasis on allowing reproducibility. 
For this reason, any forecasting methods that required high capacity computational resources in order to successfully execute were not considered. 

## Relevant literature

_Key things to aim for in the lit review: (i) Demonstrating that I know the literature, and (ii) Identifying the gap I intend to fill with this research. Be careful not to use difficult terms or concepts without having first introduced them._

There is a large and active body of research that explores different methods of controlling demand-flexible appliances under various demand side management objectives. While some involve short-term forecasting of electricity _prices_, short-term _demand_ forecasting of individual appliances is still relatively sparse in the academic literature. This section is broadly separated into two parts. The first describes literature around control of appliances for efficiency gains or demand side management, the second describes literature around electricity demand forecasting.

### Control for efficiency gains or DSM objectives

_The following simply lists articles. I may need to catagorise and order a bit more. Some may need simplifying, or otherwise have uncommon terms introduced prior to this section. In particular, it might be best to just describe ARIMA methods in terms of "conventional time series" etc rather than name them explicitly_

Ramchurn, Vytelingum, Rogers and Jennings, (2011) model households with generic storage capacity under a homeostatic control mechanism which uses linear optimisation to minimise consumption of high-carbon electricity by shifting electricity use over daily timescales in order to match predicted renewable energy availability. Reduction in residential carbon emissions of up to 25% were demonstrated, as were consumer savings of up to 14.5% under a carbon-based pricing mechanism. 

Mohsinian-Rad, Wong, Jatskevitch, Schober and Leon-Garcia (2010) modelled demand-side management of various residential appliances to minimise both cost of electricity to the consumer, and peak-to-average ratio of total load in the electricity grid. Real-time pricing signals were used as inputs in a game theoretical algorithm that optimised energy scheduling of flexible appliances for individual household cost minimisation. It was demonstrated that the Nash equilibrium obtained by these automatic energy schedulers was also the optimal solution for the electricity grid as a whole.

Cui, Wang, Wang and Zhang (2016) also used real-time pricing signals to schedule flexible appliances in a cooperative game that attempts to minimise consumer costs. Their control method used an autoregressive integrated moving average model to forecast electricity prices. These were then used as an input, along with simulated appliance demands, to an optimisation program which scheduled appliances such that their forecasted demand was fully satisfied at minimal cost. Under the profit-sharing assumptions used, residential electricity bills were shown to be reduced by about 4% while retailer's relative costs were reduced by 7.56%.

Yu, Jia, Murphy-Hoye, Pratt and Tong (2013) modelled demand-side management of various residential appliances, with emphasis on a thermal model of the household HVAC system. Instead of optimising a cost function under end-use satisfaction related constraints, their research focuses on maximising consumer satisfaction under a budget constraint. The controllers utilised model-predictive control with indoor and outdoor temperatures, insolation, weather reports, and prior electricity consumption as inputs for a mixed-integer stochastic optimisation problem, which schedules household appliances in an on/off manner.

O'Shaghnessy, Cutler, Ardani and Margolis (2018) used the U.S. National Renewable Energy Laboratory's Renewable Energy Optimisation (REOpt) and Building Energy Optimisation (BEOpt) models to mimimise the lifecycle cost of energy for a household through optimal configuration of PV, battery storage, smart domestic water heater, and smart AC unit. The household thermal storage devices (electric water heater, AC unit) were controlled through adjustment of the thermostat set-points through the day to take advantage of the daytime PV output. It was found that under current pricing, load-shifting through the use of smart AC units and smart domestic water heaters is a more cost effective method of increasing self-consumption of solar PV than the installation of batteries.

Other research focused solely on demand response of electric water heaters, usually employing more sophisticated thermal models which allow for greater understanding of potential impacts on service. 

Sepulveda, Paull, Morsi, Li, Diduch and Chang (2010) utilised a fully-mixed thermal model to investigate the potential of heterogeneous control of hot water cylinders using a binary particle swarm optimisation algorithm for the purpose of reducing grid peaks. Their direct load control modelling suggested an average reduction in peak-time electricity use of between 500W-750W per household.

Kapsalis, Safouri and Hadellis (2018) also used a fully-mixed model in a multiobjective optimisation problem that considers individual user preferences as well as a hot water consumption pattern and day-ahead electricity prices to both reduce costs under a real-time pricing plan while maintaining service, with the emphasis on cost or comfort set by individual households. An heuristic optimisation algorithm with low computational complexity was utilised to operate the controller, enabling implementation by a low-cost embedded controller and relay fitted to the heating elements of conventional water heaters. 

Kondoh, Lu, and Hammerstrom (2011) used a two-volume, vertically stratified model of a hot water cylinder with both top and bottom elements and thermostats. Usage patterns were based on hot water demand data and was simulated as discrete 2.0kWh events. The lower thermostat was controlled for varying numbers of water heaters simultaneously for the purpose of providing grid-beneficial services. It was estimated that to provide a 2-MW regulation service for 24 hours a day, it was necessary to be able to control around 33,000 water heaters.

Roux, Apperly and Booysen (2018) also use a two-volume model for their heuristic demand response solution that considers individual consumption patterns as well as hot water temperatures and physical cylinder metadata in order to reduce grid peaks as well as reduce overall energy consumption through heating water "as needed". The results showed that their proposed mechanism outperformed measured results from field units, as well as conventional "ripple controlled" units, without sacrificing user comfort.

Some research combines the computational efficiency of the single-volume well-mixed model with the physical fidelity of a multi-volume model by utilising both models for different aspects of the simulation/optimisation/control process. The control algorithm utilised by Kepplinger, Huber and Petrasch (2014) uses a single-volume well-mixed model in order to construct a cost-optimised binary switch function under real-time electricity prices using the hot water demand predicted using a kth nearest neighbour data mining algorithm. This optimised binary switch function is input along with the electrical power used by the physical hot water cylinder into a multi-volume thermal model that is used to estimate future temperatures inside the physical cylinder. These predictive temperatures are returned to the original optimisation algorithm to check that they are between the minimum and maximum temperature constraints. 

### Forecasting to improve smart-control objectives

A common theme within the literature regarding smarter control of hot water cylinders is the necessity of accurately forecasting hot water demand. An accurate demand forecast allows for more efficient energy storage and demand response capabilites, and may lessen any negative effects (running out of hot water) to the end user.
While much work has been done on medium to long term electricity demand forecasting, this thesis is concerned only with short term forecasts, and as such there is a strong emphasis on literature relating to short term forecasting.

_To each paper below, add forecast length and whether or not household data are aggregated_

Perhaps the work most similar to this thesis in the existing literature is that of Gelažanskas and Gamage[@Gelazanskas2015]. In this work, a number of statistical forecasting methods to predict domestic hot water electricity use including exponential smoothing, seasonal autoregressive moving average, and a combination of these two are explored. These models were all found to outperform benchmark models such as mean, naive, and seasonal naive, with seasonal decomposition being the most important technique for forecast accuracy. 
_points of difference: different dataset, 1 hour resolution, other appliance use not considered, uses volumetric data, forecasting horizon of 24 hours, no consideration of metrics other than accuracy_

_Need to expand upon how the models are developed, (based on historical data etc)._

After confirming the importance of accurate DHW forecasts for effective demand response, the authors in [@Lomet2015] propose the use of an ARMA model fitted to volumetric DHW consumption data for this purpose.  

Aki, Wakui and Yokoyama[@Aki2016] also use volumetric DHW data, however they opt for support vector regression (SVR) forecasting methods using a 'ground-up' approach of separating the data into estimated end-uses, such as bathing, kitchen etc.

[@Denis2019] considers the ability of forecasting to assist in reducing thermal losses from DHW tanks by controlling the operation of the device such that only the necessary amount of hot water is stored in the tank at once. An ARIMA model is utilised along with the TRNSYS energy simulation software. Overall energy reductions of up to 17.4% were demonstrated under this control scenario.

_Make sure introduction has provided sufficient information that the reader will understand the research aims in next subsection. By the time I get here it should be clear exactly what the problem is about and that I am trying a new approach to solve the problem_

## Aims

This project analyses and models residential electricity demand data in order to determine forecastability of residential hot water electricity use from smart meters with separately metered hot water, as is commonly encountered in New Zealand. This would assist in controlling hot water electricity for demand response and/or efficiency improvements by reducing negative effects on service. In addition, it may provide the means for hot water cylinders to participate in half-hour ahead demand response markets by providing the ability to bid an estimated capacity for load-shedding according to forecasted demand. It is an exploratory analysis and examines a number of different forecasting methods, selected based on their suitability to the task according to similar research in existing literature. _state which ones, and why they were chosen over others_ The selected models are then compared to one another using relevant metrics _at least hint at metrics before this_ in the conclusion.

Chapter \@ref(results) demonstrates the effectiveness of a number of statistical models to forecast hot water electricity demand of each household using half-hour averaged data. This is currently the form which is stored and transmitted by smart meters in New Zealand currently. 
The exploratory techniques and predictive models utilised are all described and discussed immediately proceeding the results of their forecasts, as this provides tangible examples to assist in their comprehension.
Each forecasting model used is then compared to one another by a number or relevant metrics. These comparative results are provided in the Conclusion (Chapter \@ref(conclusion)).
