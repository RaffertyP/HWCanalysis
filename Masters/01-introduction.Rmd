## Demand side management

Total electricity demand varies throughout time, with daily demand patterns in New Zealand generally exhibiting two peaks, one in the morning and one in the evening[@TranspowerNZ2015].

_Distinguish between local network and national peaks, as well as daily peaks from extreme events and seasonal peaks?_ 

As electrical energy cannot be stored, electricity supply must match this fluctuating demand, requiring underutilised generation and transmission infrustructure to be available on demand, a costly and inefficient situation[@Strbac2008]. 
In New Zealand, every additional kW of peak time demand is estimated to require up to $200/year in additional infrastructure costs[@Jack].
The challenges associated with supplying electricity in order to effectively meet demand are likely to be exacerbated by the predicted increase of renewable energy in the grid, as renewable energy generation is often reliant on weather conditions, and consequently can not easily be shifted to meet demand[@Lund2015].
Demand side management is the process of adjusting demand to meet supply, and may play a vital role in the transition to a low-carbon electricity grid. Many electricity using devices can have their use times shifted on a daily scale with limited impact to the end user (a property referred to as "flexibility"). Devices such as washing machines and dishwashers exhibit this property, along with battery storage systems in the form of electric cars and bicycles, and thermostatically controlled appliances including heat pumps, as well as the focus of this thesis, electric hot water cylinders (HWCs).
The ability of the HWC to store and retain up to 10kWh of energy in the form of heat renders them perfect candidates for control, and could be considered one of the most “flexible” appliances in New Zealand households[@Stephenson2017].

## Why predict hot water electricity demand

In New Zealand, residential electricity usage contributes around half of peak demand[@ElectricityCommission2007] and residential hot water use is around 30% of residential energy used[@Pollard2002]. The tendency of people showering or bathing either before leaving the house or in the evenings means that weekday residential hot water usage often occurs during network peaks in demand. A study by the Household Energy End Use Project (HEEP) showed that hot water usage makes up to 36% of residential peak demand [@Pollard2002] and data from the GREEN Grid project suggesting it may be up to 50%[@Jack]. 
In New Zealand, electric hot water cylinders (HWCs) are very common, with 91% of households having electricity as an energy source for water heating[@Pollard2002]. 
While control of hot water cylinders for DSM objectives is possible without demand forecasting, the ability to accurately predict future demand allows more finely-tuned control that may be catered to the use patterns of individual households, allowing a greater range of control without negative effects to the end-user[@Lomet2015].
An additional benefit of hot water demand forecasting is that of reducing thermal losses[@Denis2019]. 
Hot water cylinders under normal usage conditions have a tendency to 'stratify' their contents into distict bodies of water, namely a hot upper layer of water and a cool lower layer of water, separated by a thin thermocline[@JackDew2018].
The household residents may use hot water with no noticeable changes in temperature until the hotter top layer suddenly runs out, causing the unpleasant 'cold water event', familar to many who live in a household with heavy hot water use.
For those households with moderate to low hot water demand however, their hot water cylinder may be keeping a far greater amount of water hot than they would expect to use.
As no insulation is perfect, any object that is hotter than its surroundings will suffer from heat loss, with the amount of heat lost being proportional to the difference in temperature between the body and the surroundings. 
Thus, all else being held equal, a warmer body loses more energy to it's surroundings than a cooler one.
For this reason, the ability to store only as much hot water as will be required by the household (with the remainder of the tank being left as cooler water) has the potential to significantly reduce hot water electricity consumption[@Denis2019]. 

## Forecasting overview

_Time series_ data is that which involves measurements of variables sequentially or at fixed intervals of time[@Cowpertwait2009].
This data may then be processed, analysed and extrapolated in a manner that produces predictions of future events or occurrences, a process known as 'forecasting'. 
There are number of different methods of forecasting time series data.
Although the distinction is subtle, these methods may be broadly separated into two catagories; (i) conventional, and (ii) artificial intelligence (AI)[@MatDaut2017].

### Conventional forecasting methods

Conventional methods may again be broadly separated into two separate techniques.

[^1]: Data in general can be thought to be made up of dependent and independent (or 'explanatory') variables. Broadly speaking, dependent variables are those we are interested in measuring or predicting (in this research, hot water electricity demand). Explanatory variables are those we expect to impact our dependent variables (in this research we use time and the electricity demand of other appliances).

One conventional forecasting method utilises data of separate but related (explanatory[^1]) variables and makes predictions based on basic statistical relationships between them. These are often referred to as _causal_ models[@Hong2016]. Regression analysis is a causal model commonly used in electricity forecasting, and may be understood as follows:
If there is the ability to know (or sufficiently accurately predict) the value(s) of the independant variable(s) at a particular future time, then a forecast for the dependent variable may be calculated at that same time based on the usual relationship between them.
In the context of electricity demand forecasting, relevant predictable independent variables may be social factors such as public holidays, or (accurately forecasted) weather conditions[@Wei2018].
However if there is no obtainable value(s) for the independent variable(s) at the future time for which a prediction is required, more subtle techniques must be employed. 
One option is to establish a relationship between the value(s) of the independent variables and the following values of the dependent variable. In the context of DHW electricity demand forecasting, this may be the relationship between the electricity demand of other appliances, and subsequent values of DHW electricity demand.

Another conventional forecasting method utilises the fundamental properties of only the time series data of the variable being predicted.
This method is referred to as _time series analysis_.
On important technique used in time series analysis is the separation of the data into individual components, namely trend, cycles and 'noise'. 
In the context of DHW electricity time series data, the trend would be a gradual increase (or decrease) in average hot water use over long periods of time, the cycles would be average daily use patterns such as morning and evening peaks previously mentioned, and the noise is essentially any deviation of the data from the trend and cycle components (people not actually using hot water according to strict mathematical relationships).
Additionally, forecasts may be made by understanding the relationships between a variable and its previous values. Autoregression (AR) and moving average (MA) are two commonly utilised techniques to obtain these relationships. In the context of DHW forecasting this method may be best interpreted as an understanding of the lengths of time a water heater element will typically remain on (or off) for. 

_Include MCMC? a couple of papers utilise it but I believe it's better suited to modelling/scenarios than forecasts_

### AI forecasting methods

Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods are those that use more complex techniques from the field of machine learning for forecasting.
These methods can be considered separate from their conventional counterparts by their ability to process and establish relationships between data in a more autonomous fashion. 
In general, AI methods rely more on algorithms and large amounts of computational power than conventional forecasting methods, while conventional methods rely more on human intuition and statistics than AI methods.
Two commonly used techniques in this field are those of artificial neural networks (ANN) and support vector machines (SVM).

ANNs attempt to mimic biological learning mechanisms by processing a set of training data through clusters of artificial neurons, each of which individually recieve (numerical) inputs, assign them certain weights, and then output the weighted value into other artificial neurons, which perform the same task, until eventually producing a final output.
The weights assigned by each neuron are then iteratively adjusted in order to minimise the error of the final output.

While Hippert, Pedreira, and Souza[@Hippert2014] state in 2001 that ANNs do not outperform conventional forecasting methods in accuracy, a more recent analysis from Raza and Khosravi[@Raza2015] in 2015 claims the contrary.
Despite this recent claim to superiority in forecast accuracy, the computational expense of training ANNs can be a hindrance to large-scale adoption, as it generally involves a time-consuming process using expensive and energy-intensive computers.
While still an active research area, Figure \@ref(fig:ANNinDF) indicates that research in ANNs for electricity demand forecasting may have peaked, and now be diminishing.
```{r ANNinDF, out.width='100%', fig.cap="Documents in SCOPUS containing keywords: artificial AND neural AND network AND electricity AND demand AND forecasting"}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(pFile, "artificial_neural_network_electricity_demand_forecasting.png"))
```

This may be due to increasing interest in an alternative AI forecasting method for electricity demand forecasting, that of support vector machines (SVMs).
Support vector machines classify data points by mapping them in hyperspace and distinguising between them according to which side of a hyperplane they fall on, with the position of the classifying hyperplanes being constructed iteratively in order to maximise the perpendicular distance between each hyperplane and the closest samples on either side of it (refer to Figure \@ref(fig:SVM_example). Non-linear partitions can be constructed using a kernel function.
Support vector machines may be used in electricity forecasting by automating the process of discovering, catagorising and quantifying various relationships within the data, such as those previously described as part of time series analysis and causal modelling[@Wei2018].


```{r SVMexample, out.width='100%', fig.cap="Example demonstrating the classifying mechanism of a SVM. Image by Larhmam - Own work, CC BY-SA 4.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=73710028"}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(pFile, "SVMmargin.png"))
```

This method is far less computationally expensive to train than ANNs, and has no indication of a reduction in research interest in the context of electricity demand forecasting, as can be seen in Figure \@ref(fig:SVMinDF).

```{r SVMinDF, out.width='100%', fig.cap="Documents in SCOPUS containing keywords: support AND vector AND network AND electricity AND demand AND forecasting"}

_The following simply lists articles. I need to instead catagorise and order the literature. Be careful not to use difficult terms or concepts without having first introduced them._

_Key things to aim for in the lit review: (i) Demonstrating that I know the literature, and (ii) Identifying the gap I intend to fill with this research._

There is a large and active body of research that explores different methods of controlling demand-flexible appliances under various demand side management objectives. While some involve forecasting of electricity prices, appliance-level demand forecasting is sparse in the academic literature. This section is broadly separated into two parts. The first describes literature around control of appliances for demand side management, the second describes literature around electricity demand forecasting.

Ramchurn, Vytelingum, Rogers and Jennings, (2011) model households with generic storage capacity under a homeostatic control mechanism which uses linear optimisation to minimise consumption of high-carbon electricity by shifting electricity use over daily timescales in order to match predicted renewable energy availability. Reduction in residential carbon emissions of up to 25% were demonstrated, as were consumer savings of up to 14.5% under a carbon-based pricing mechanism. 

Mohsinian-Rad, Wong, Jatskevitch, Schober and Leon-Garcia (2010) modelled demand-side management of various residential appliances to minimise both cost of electricity to the consumer, and peak-to-average ratio of total load in the electricity grid. Real-time pricing signals were used as inputs in a game theoretical algorithm that optimised energy scheduling of flexible appliances for individual household cost minimisation. It was demonstrated that the Nash equilibrium obtained by these automatic energy schedulers was also the optimal solution for the electricity grid as a whole.

Cui, Wang, Wang and Zhang (2016) also used real-time pricing signals to schedule flexible appliances in a cooperative game that attempts to minimise consumer costs. Their control method used an autoregressive integrated moving average model to forecast electricity prices. These were then used as an input, along with simulated appliance demands, to an optimisation program which scheduled appliances such that their forecasted demand was fully satisfied at minimal cost. Under the profit-sharing assumptions used, residential electricity bills were shown to be reduced by about 4% while retailer's relative costs were reduced by 7.56%.

Yu, Jia, Murphy-Hoye, Pratt and Tong (2013) modelled demand-side management of various residential appliances, with emphasis on a thermal model of the household HVAC system. Instead of optimising a cost function under end-use satisfaction related constraints, their research focuses on maximising consumer satisfaction under a budget constraint. The controllers utilised model-predictive control with indoor and outdoor temperatures, insolation, weather reports, and prior electricity consumption as inputs for a mixed-integer stochastic optimisation problem, which schedules household appliances in an on/off manner.

O'Shaghnessy, Cutler, Ardani and Margolis (2018) used the U.S. National Renewable Energy Laboratory's Renewable Energy Optimisation (REOpt) and Building Energy Optimisation (BEOpt) models to mimimise the lifecycle cost of energy for a household through optimal configuration of PV, battery storage, smart domestic water heater, and smart AC unit. The household thermal storage devices (electric water heater, AC unit) were controlled through adjustment of the thermostat set-points through the day to take advantage of the daytime PV output. It was found that under current pricing, load-shifting through the use of smart AC units and smart domestic water heaters is a more cost effective method of increasing self-consumption of solar PV than the installation of batteries.

Other research focused solely on demand response of electric water heaters, usually employing more sophisticated thermal models which allow for greater understanding of potential impacts on service. _XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX_

Sepulveda, Paull, Morsi, Li, Diduch and Chang (2010) utilised a fully-mixed thermal model to investigate the potential of heterogeneous control of hot water cylinders using a binary particle swarm optimisation algorithm for the purpose of reducing grid peaks. Their direct load control modelling suggested an average reduction in peak-time electricity use of between 500W-750W per household.

Kapsalis, Safouri and Hadellis (2018) also used a fully-mixed model in a multiobjective optimisation problem that considers individual user preferences as well as a hot water consumption pattern and day-ahead electricity prices to both reduce costs under a real-time pricing plan while maintaining service, with the emphasis on cost or comfort set by individual households. An heuristic optimisation algorithm with low computational complexity was utilised to operate the controller, enabling implementation by a low-cost embedded controller and relay fitted to the heating elements of conventional water heaters. 

Kondoh, Lu, and Hammerstrom (2011) used a two-volume, vertically stratified model of a hot water cylinder with both top and bottom elements and thermostats. Usage patterns were based on hot water demand data and was simulated as discrete 2.0kWh events. The lower thermostat was controlled for varying numbers of water heaters simultaneously for the purpose of providing grid-beneficial services. It was estimated that to provide a 2-MW regulation service for 24 hours a day, it was necessary to be able to control around 33,000 water heaters.

Roux, Apperly and Booysen (2018) also use a two-volume model for their heuristic demand response solution that considers individual consumption patterns as well as hot water temperatures and physical cylinder metadata in order to reduce grid peaks as well as reduce overall energy consumption through heating water "as needed". The results showed that their proposed mechanism outperformed measured results from field units, as well as conventional "ripple controlled" units, without sacrificing user comfort.

Some research combines the computational efficiency of the single-volume well-mixed model with the physical fidelity of a multi-volume model by utilising both models for different aspects of the simulation/optimisation/control process. The control algorithm utilised by Kepplinger, Huber and Petrasch (2014) uses a single-volume well-mixed model in order to construct a cost-optimised binary switch function under real-time electricity prices using the hot water demand predicted using a kth nearest neighbour data mining algorithm. This optimised binary switch function is input along with the electrical power used by the physical hot water cylinder into a multi-volume thermal model that is used to estimate future temperatures inside the physical cylinder. These predictive temperatures are returned to the original optimisation algorithm to check that they are between the minimum and maximum temperature constraints. 

A common theme within the literature regarding the utilision of hot water cylinders for the purpose of demand side management is the necessity of accurately forecasting hot water demand. An accurate demand forecast allows for more efficient energy storage and demand response capabilites, and may lessen any negative effects (running out of hot water) to the end user.

Forecasting literature may be broadly classified using two separate attributes; (i) forecasting period, and (ii) forecasting method.
Forecasting period can be further separated into three catagories[@Ahmad2014]. Short term load forecasting (STLF) is usually used to refer to predictions of less than 24 hours, although it can refer to forecast periods of up to one week. Medium term load forecasting (MTLF) refers to predictions between one week and one year. Long term load forecasting (LTLF) is for predictions spanning longer than one year.

Gelažanskas and Gamage[@Gelazanskas2015] explore a number of statistical forecasting methods to predict domestic hot water electricity use including exponential smoothing, seasonal autoregressive moving average, and a combination of these two. These models were all found to outperform benchmark models such as mean, naive, and seasonal naive, with seasonal decomposition being the most important technique for forecast accuracy. _Need to expand upon how the models are developed, (based on historical data etc)._

After confirming the importance of accurate DHW forecasts for effective demand response, the authors in [@Lomet2015] propose the use of an ARMA model fitted to volumetric DHW consumption data for this purpose.  

Aki, Wakui and Yokoyama[@Aki2016] also use volumetric DHW data, however they opt for support vector regression (SVR) forecasting methods using a 'ground-up' approach of separating the data into estimated end-uses, such as bathing, kitchen etc.

[@Denis2019] considers the ability of forecasting to assist in reducing thermal losses from DHW tanks by controlling the operation of the device such that only the necessary amount of hot water is stored in the tank at once. An ARIMA model is utilised along with the TRNSYS energy simulation software. Overall energy reductions of up to 17.4% were demonstrated under this control scenario.

## Aims

This project analyses and models the GREEN Grid data in order to determine forecastability of residential hot water electricity use from smart meters with separately metered hot water, as is commonly encountered in New Zealand. This would assist in controlling hot water electricity for demand response by reducing negative effects on service. In addition, it may provide the means for hot water cylinders to participate in half-hour ahead demand response markets by providing the ability to bid an estimated capacity for load-shedding according to forecasted demand. It is an exploratory analysis and examines a number of different forecasting methods, which are compared to one another relevant metrics in the conclusion.

## Thesis structure

The main body of analysis is broadly broken into four sections. 
Chapter \@ref(methodology) introduces the models utilised in the context of electricity demand, and describes the metrics by which the models are compared to one another.
Chapter \@ref(data-prelim) explains the cleaning and preparatory process, and then provides a broad overview of various relevant patterns and attributes of the data. 
Chapter \@ref(half-hour) explores a number of statistical models to forecast hot water electricity demand of each household using half-hour averaged data. This is currently the form which is stored and transmitted by smart meters in New Zealand currently. 
Chapter \@ref(one-min) uses similar models adapted for a one minute frequency, with forecasts predicting a "binary" probabilistic outcome of element on/element off, as this provides closer approximation to the physical process of electricity use of a hot water cylinder.
The exploratory techniques and predictive models utilised are all described and discussed immediately proceeding the results of their forecasts, as this provides tangible examples to assist in their comprehension.
Each forecasting model used is then compared to one another by a number or relevant metrics. These comparative results are provided in the Conclusion (Chapter \@ref(conclusion)).
