This file describes properties of the numbered houses in the dataset that make them unsuitable
for our analysis, and provides a list of houses that are suitable.

For more information see the Documentation section at https://cfsotago.github.io/GREENGridData/

UPDATED:

Numbers not in dataset: rf_03 through rf_05
Empty data file: rf_02
Removed immediately as per github instructions : rf_15, rf_17, rf_46
Data doesn't have seperate hot water metering: rf_07, rf_09, rf_10, rf_17b, rf_19, rf_21, rf_26, rf_28, rf_41, rf_43, rf_47
Hot water is heated with heat pump: rf_11 
Household has controlled hot water (home energy management system): rf_23* and rf_24*
Extended periods with zero HW electricity: rf_27
Zero HW electricity recorded after 26 Feb 2016: rf_31
Negative values recorded before 01 Jul 2015: rf_14

Note: currently unsure whether missing data would negatively effect the modelling
MAY need to EXCLUDE the following
Chunk of missing values:
rf_06: before 18 Jan 2015 and after 27 Feb 2017
rf_12: before 04 Jan 2015
rf_15b: after 03 Sep 2015
fr_34: before 27 Mar 2015
rf_35: before 13 Jul 2016
rf_36: before 04 Dec 2017
rf_39: before 20 May 2015 and after 19 Nov 2017
STILL TO WORK OUT EXACT DATES:
30, 33, 38, 
                        
rf_02 and rf_13 have strange demand profiles (see plots in plots/prelim/)
Unsure what to do about this.

This leaves suitable houses: 

01, 06, 08, 13, 14(***), 15b, 22, 24*, 25, 29, 30, 31(***), 32, 33,
34**, 35**, 36**, 37, 38, 40, 42**, 44, 45**, 

* Household has photovoltaic system
** Hot water not on ripple control
*** Missing/negative values need deleting
