INITIALISE runs all necessary scripts in the correct order, 
HOWEVER, before it will work:
  paths to data folder ("dFile") and where to store any generated plot ("pFile") need to be defined
  imputeTotalPower needs data filepaths changed 
  circuitsToSum file must be downloaded from GREENGrid github (if not processing using the GREENGrid package)
  extractCircuitFromCleanGridSpy needs data filepaths changed appropriately
  Houses 15 and 17 need to be deleted as per GREENGrid github instructions

Scripts extractCircuitFromCleanGridSpy and imputeTotalPower are taken from https://github.com/CfSOtago/GREENGridData
