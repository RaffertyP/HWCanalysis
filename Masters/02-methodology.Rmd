The data used for this analysis was collected from monitoring the submetered electrical power usage of 44 households in Hawkes Bay and Taranaki, New Zealand, at one minute intervals between 2014 and 2018 as part of the GREEN Grid project[@GREENGrid]. It is publically available from the UK Data Service. More information about this dataset, including detailed reports of data issues, the cleaning process, and access instructions, is available at https://cfsotago.github.io/GREENGridData/.

All data processing and modelling was conducted using the `R` programming language, and significant consideration has been given to facilitating reproducibility of results. The code is publically available under an Apache License (version 2.0) at https://github.com/raffertyparker/HWCanalysis.

The analysis is broadly broken into three sections. 
Chapter \@ref(data-prelim) explains the cleaning and preperatory process, and then provides a broad overview of various relevant patterns and attributes of the dataset. 
Smart meters in New Zealand currently store (and transmit) data that is averaged over half-hour periods. Chapter \@ref(half-hour) explores a number of statistical models of each household using half-hour averaged data. 
Chapter \@ref(one-min) uses similar models adapted for a one minute frequency, as this provides closer approximation to the physical process of the hot water cylinder element.
The exploratory texchniques and predictive models utilised are all described and discussed immediately proceeding the results of their forecasts, as this provides tangible examples to assist in their comprehension.
Each forecasting model used is then compared to one another by the sum of the root mean squared of the difference between the predicted value and the acual value (known as the 'residual'). These comparative results are provided in the Conclusion (Chapter \@ref(conclusion)).
