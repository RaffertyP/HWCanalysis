INITIALISE runs all necessary scripts in the correct order, 
HOWEVER, before it will work:
  paths to where to store any generated plots ("pFile") MAY need to be defined in filepaths.R (hopefully not any more)
  imputeTotalPower needs data filepaths changed appropriately to read UKDS data
  circuitsToSum file must be downloaded from GREENGrid github (if not processing using the GREENGrid package)
  extractCircuitFromCleanGridSpy may also need data filepaths changed appropriately
  Houses 15 and 17 need to be deleted as per GREENGrid github instructions

Scripts extractCircuitFromCleanGridSpy and imputeTotalPower are taken from https://github.com/CfSOtago/GREENGridData
