# Discussion

Note that our seasonal naive model is outperformed by our naive model in accuracy. This is in contrast to the findings in [@Gelazanskas2015]. The reason for this may lie in the data itself, with the UK households having more weekly regularity than the NZ households used in this research. Alternatively, this discrepancy may lie in the differences in data resolution or forecast length.

Unsurprisingly, increasing the complexity of the models tends to increase both the accuracy of the model, and the time taken to fit.
Increasing computational time doesn't necessarily ensure increased accuracy however, as the SVM model has a fitting time that is two orders of magnitude higher than that of the conventional models, while being slightly outperformed by the STL + ARIMAX model in accuracy. 
However, the STL + ARIMAX model required significantly more human input to devolop than the SVM did.
All models are less accurate during peak periods, however those that incorporate the STL decomposition have a smaller percentage increase in errors than others, due to the consideration of seasonal effects.
The SVM model displayed the largest percentage increase in error during peak periods.

## Simulation suitability

The models utilised in this thesis assume the dependent variables are continuous and have no upper or lower bounds. In particular, while being fit to simply minimise the RSS, they may predict values that are greater than the maximum element power or less than zero, and series' of values that are 'smoother' than the original data. 

This is particularly pronounced when considering data at 1 minute resolution. At this timescale, the true nature of the hot water element as an "on/off" device becomes apparent. See Figure \@ref(fig:elementPlot) for an example of this behaviour.
