Flexibility - the ability for an appliance to shift its electricity demand in time with little impact to the end user
RMSE - accuracy metric, "root mean squared error". See Equation \@ref(eq:RMSE)
White noise - a set of independent and identically distributed variables with an expected value of zero
Backshift operator - Shifts value to a previous one in the series - see equation \@ref(eq:BSO) 
Residual - error in the model, $\hat x_t - x_t$
$y_t$ - electricity demand of other appliances at time $t$
RSS - residual sum of squares
SVM - support vector machine
ANN - artificial neural network
AIC - Akaike Information Criterion
PEI - percentage error increase, see Eq. \@ref(eq:PEI)
