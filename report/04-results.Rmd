This chapter uses a selection of models fitted to our half hour averaged data in order to forecast the demand of the following half hour.

## Naive model

In our naive model we assume no drift, and only attempt to predict one (half hour) time step onto the future. From Equation \@ref(eq:randomWalk), we get 
\begin{equation}
\hat x_{t+1} = x_t .
\end{equation}

```{r randomWalk, echo=FALSE, out.width='100%', fig.cap="Actual electricity use and naive model approximation over one day for four households"}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(pFolder, "naive/fourHouses.pdf"))
```

As can be seen in Figure \@ref(fig:randomWalk), this method is reasonably effective for some houses, in particular those that have long periods where the element power has roughly the same avaraged output. In contrast, households that exhibit frequent oscillation of element power are very poorly modelled by this method, with the predicted values consistently 'missing' the actual values.

The naive model has RMSE ranging between `r round(min(dfSummary$RMSE[dfSummary$model == "naive"]), 2)`W and `r round(max(dfSummary$RMSE[dfSummary$model == "naive"]), 2)`W, with the average being `r round(DFsummary$RMSE[DFsummary$model == "naive"], 2)`W.

During peak periods, RMSEs ranged between `r round(min(dfSummary$peakRMSE[dfSummary$model == "naive"]), 2)`W and `r round(max(dfSummary$peakRMSE[dfSummary$model == "naive"]), 2)`W, with the average being `r round(DFsummary$peakRMSE[DFsummary$model == "naive"], 2)`W.

The model precisely mimics the actual data with a half-hour lag, and therefore scores highly for physical fidelity. Interpretability is high as this model is represented by a very simple equation, although no illumination as to underlying behavioural properties are provided by this model. The computational time to fit models to each household varied between `r round(min(dfSummary$fittingTime[dfSummary$model == "naive"]), 2)`s and `r round(max(dfSummary$fittingTime[dfSummary$model == "naive"]), 2)`s, with the average taking `r round(DFsummary$fittingTime[DFsummary$model == "naive"], 2)`s.

```{r naiveResiduals, echo=FALSE, out.width='100%', fig.cap="Aggregated half-hourly average residuals for the naive model"}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(pFolder, "naive/allHousesResidual.pdf"))
```

Examination of the aggregated daily average residuals shows that this model performs quite poorly during peak periods, with RMSE during peak periods being `r round(DFsummary$pcErrorIncrease[DFsummary$model == "naive"], 2)`% greater than average.

## Seasonal naive

Similarly to our naive model, the seasonal naive model predicts one (half hour) time step onto the future utilising only one prior observation. Where the seasonal naive differs is that it assumes the most likely value for hot water demand will be the value at that same time one week prior, giving $\hat x_{t+1} = x_{t-(48 \times 7) + 1}$. 

```{r seasonalNaivePlot, echo=FALSE, out.width='100%', fig.cap="Actual electricity use and seasonal naive model approximation over one day for four households"}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(pFolder, "seasonalNaive/fourHouses.pdf"))
```

As can be seen in Figure \@ref(fig:seasonalNaivePlot), this method is reasonably ineffective, although in some instances it makes very accurate predictions of the initial instance of the element turning on, usually a difficult task. 

The seasonal naive model has RMSE ranging between `r round(min(dfSummary$RMSE[dfSummary$model == "seasonalNaive"]), 2)`W and `r round(max(dfSummary$RMSE[dfSummary$model == "seasonalNaive"]), 2)`W, with the average being `r round(DFsummary$RMSE[DFsummary$model == "seasonalNaive"], 2)`W.

During peak periods, RMSEs ranged between `r round(min(dfSummary$peakRMSE[dfSummary$model == "seasonalNaive"]), 2)`W and `r round(max(dfSummary$peakRMSE[dfSummary$model == "seasonalNaive"]), 2)`W, with the average being `r round(DFsummary$peakRMSE[DFsummary$model == "seasonalNaive"], 2)`W.

The model precisely mimics the actual data with a week long lag, and therefore scores highly for physical fidelity. Interpretability is high as this model is represented by a very simple equation, but the only illumination this model provides into behavioural properties of hot water use are with respect to how strictly a household follows weekly cycles of demand. The computational time to fit models to each household varied between `r round(min(dfSummary$fittingTime[dfSummary$model == "seasonalNaive"]), 2)`s and `r round(max(dfSummary$fittingTime[dfSummary$model == "seasonalNaive"]), 2)`s, with the average taking `r round(DFsummary$fittingTime[DFsummary$model == "seasonalNaive"], 2)`s.

```{r seasonalNaiveResiduals, echo=FALSE, out.width='100%', fig.cap="Aggregated half-hourly average residuals for the seasonal naive model"}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(pFolder, "seasonalNaive/allHousesResidual.pdf"))
```

Examination of the aggregated daily average residuals shows that despite attempting to consider cyclic effects, this model performs very poorly during peak periods, with a peak period RMSE increase of `r round(DFsummary$pcErrorIncrease[DFsummary$model == "seasonalNaive"], 2)`%, slightly higher than that of the naive model.

## Simple linear regression

While simple linear regression is a useful method of analysing data that has a roughly linear trend, it is generally inadequate when constructed using time series data that displays cyclic behaviour, such as residential electricity demand.
Where it may be useful, however, is in predicting the relationship between hot water electricity demand and non hot water electricity demand.
The significance of the cross-correlogram (Fig. \@ref(fig:crossCovariance)) in the initial positive lags suggests we may be able to construct a simple linear model which forecasts hot water electricity use based on the previous half-hour's non hot water electricity use.

```{r linearRelations, echo=FALSE, out.width='100%', fig.cap="Linear relation between non hot water electricity and half-hour lagged hot water electricity for household 13"}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(pFolder, "rf_13LinearPlot.png"))
```

Figure \@ref(fig:linearRelations) shows a simple linear regression of current non hot water electricity demand with the following half-hour's hot water electricity demand. This is shown to demonstrate the ability to use current electricity demand to predict hot water electricity demand over the next half hour. Note the low $R^2$ value suggesting that, in it's current form, this model would be rather inadequate at forecasting demand.

```{r simpleLinear, echo=FALSE, out.width='100%', fig.cap="Performance of simple linear regression model for four households over four separate days"}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(pFolder, "simpleLinear/fourHouses.pdf"))
```
Figure \@ref(fig:simpleLinear) shows the effectiveness of this model for four separate households. 
<!--
Different households used!

Note that the top two households in the figure, `rf_13` and `rf_30`, show the model fitting reasonable poorly with the data. 
Household `rf_13` appears to predict increase in hot water electricity demand before it actually occurs. 
This should be compared to Figure \@ref(fig:crossCovariance), which shows the correllation between hot water and not hot water electricity peaking at around 200 minutes lag for this household.
Household `rf_30` shows a model which appears to be very unresponsive to the data. Again, on close examination of Figure \@ref(fig:crossCovariance) we see that this household has a peak in crosscorrelation at around 800 minutes. 
This indicates that for some households, a correlation lag of greater than 30 mins may increase accuracy. 
Households `rf_42` and `rf_44` show a more accurate model result, however due to the presence of a non-zero y intercept these models will always consistently overestimate hot water electricity whenever the true value is zero.
-->
The simple linear regression model has RMSE ranging between `r round(min(dfSummary$RMSE[dfSummary$model == "simpleLinear"]), 2)`W and `r round(max(dfSummary$RMSE[dfSummary$model == "simpleLinear"]), 2)`W, with the average being `r round(DFsummary$RMSE[DFsummary$model == "simpleLinear"], 2)`W.

During peak periods, RMSEs ranged between `r round(min(dfSummary$peakRMSE[dfSummary$model == "simpleLinear"]), 2)`W and `r round(max(dfSummary$peakRMSE[dfSummary$model == "simpleLinear"]), 2)`W, with the average being `r round(DFsummary$peakRMSE[DFsummary$model == "simpleLinear"], 2)`W.

The model does not accurately capture zero values, and is significantly smoother than the actual data, however no negative values are present. It therefore scores low to moderate for physical fidelity. 
Interpretability is high, as the output can be understood by the simple equation $\hat x_{t+1} = \alpha_0 + \alpha_1 w_t$, where $w_t$ is non hot water electricity at time $t$.  The computational time to fit models to each household varied between `r round(min(dfSummary$fittingTime[dfSummary$model == "simpleLinear"]), 2)`s and `r round(max(dfSummary$fittingTime[dfSummary$model == "simpleLinear"]), 2)`s, with the average taking `r round(DFsummary$fittingTime[DFsummary$model == "simpleLinear"], 2)`s.

Notably, this model has lower RMSE's than the Naive model.
In addition, this model lends itself to being utilised as an input into more complex models that take other parameters into consideration. 

```{r simpleLinearResiduals, echo=FALSE, out.width='100%', fig.cap="Aggregated half-hourly average residuals for the simple linear regression model"}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(pFolder, "simpleLinear/allHousesResidual.pdf"))
```

This model performed particularly poorly during peak periods, with a peak period RMSE increase of `r round(DFsummary$pcErrorIncrease[DFsummary$model == "simpleLinear"], 2)`%.

## ARIMA model

As each household has different usage patterns and characteristics, optimal values for parameters $p$, $d$, and $q$ (see Section \@ref(ARIMAmethodology)) differ for each household.
Parameters are selected in order to minimise the AIC (Equation \@ref(eq:AIC)) are provided in the Appendix. To restrict computational expense in model fitting, maximum values for $p$, $d$ and $q$ are fixed at 5, 2 and 5, respectively.

The ARIMA model has RMSE ranging between `r round(min(dfSummary$RMSE[dfSummary$model == "ARIMA"]), 2)`W and `r round(max(dfSummary$RMSE[dfSummary$model == "ARIMA"]), 2)`W, with the average being `r round(DFsummary$RMSE[DFsummary$model == "ARIMA"], 2)`W.

During peak periods, RMSEs ranged between `r round(min(dfSummary$peakRMSE[dfSummary$model == "ARIMA"]), 2)`W and `r round(max(dfSummary$peakRMSE[dfSummary$model == "ARIMA"]), 2)`W, with the average being `r round(DFsummary$peakRMSE[DFsummary$model == "ARIMA"], 2)`W.

The model does not often predict the initial instance of the element turning on, and is somewhat smoother than the actual data. In addition, occasional negative values or values above that capable of the element occur. It scores low to moderate for physical fidelity. 
Interpretability is moderate, as, given familiarity with the model, the output can be understood by the value of the $p$, $d$ and $q$ parameters. The computational time to fit models to each household varied between `r round(min(dfSummary$fittingTime[dfSummary$model == "ARIMA"]), 2)`s and `r round(max(dfSummary$fittingTime[dfSummary$model == "ARIMA"]), 2)`s, with the average taking `r round(DFsummary$fittingTime[DFsummary$model == "ARIMA"], 2)`s.

```{r ARIMAplot, echo=FALSE, out.width='100%', fig.cap="Performance of ARIMA model for four households over four separate days"}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(pFolder, "/ARIMA/fourHouses.pdf"))
```

```{r ARIMAresiduals, echo=FALSE, out.width='100%', fig.cap="Aggregated half-hourly average residuals for the ARIMA model"}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(pFolder, "ARIMA/allHousesResidual.pdf"))
```

Examination of the aggregated daily average residuals shows that this model also underperforms during peak periods, with a peak period RMSE increase of `r round(DFsummary$pcErrorIncrease[DFsummary$model == "ARIMA"], 2)`%.

## ARIMAX model

As for the ARIMA model, optimal values for parameters $p$, $d$, and $q$ (see Section \@ref(ARIMAmethodology)) differ for each household, and are provided in the Appendix. Maximum values for $p$, $d$ and $q$ are again fixed at 5, 2 and 5, respectively.

The ARIMAX model has RMSE ranging between `r round(min(dfSummary$RMSE[dfSummary$model == "ARIMAX"]), 2)`W and `r round(max(dfSummary$RMSE[dfSummary$model == "ARIMAX"]), 2)`W, with the average being `r round(DFsummary$RMSE[DFsummary$model == "ARIMAX"], 2)`W.

During peak periods, RMSEs ranged between `r round(min(dfSummary$peakRMSE[dfSummary$model == "ARIMAX"]), 2)`W and `r round(max(dfSummary$peakRMSE[dfSummary$model == "ARIMAX"]), 2)`W, with the average being `r round(DFsummary$peakRMSE[DFsummary$model == "ARIMAX"], 2)`W.

The model is slightly better than the ARIMA at predicting the initial instance of the element turning on, and shows similar behaviour with respect to the model being smoother than the actual data. Occasional negative values or values above that capable of the element occur. It scores low to moderate for physical fidelity. 
Interpretability is moderate, as the output can be understood by the value of the $p$, $d$ and $q$ parameters, along with the values given to the regressors. The computational time to fit models to each household varied between `r round(min(dfSummary$fittingTime[dfSummary$model == "ARIMAX"]), 2)`s and `r round(max(dfSummary$fittingTime[dfSummary$model == "ARIMAX"]), 2)`s, with the average taking `r round(DFsummary$fittingTime[DFsummary$model == "ARIMAX"], 2)`s.

```{r ARIMAXplot, echo=FALSE, out.width='100%', fig.cap="Performance of ARIMAX model for four households over four separate days"}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(pFolder, "/ARIMAX/fourHouses.pdf"))
```

```{r ARIMAXresiduals, echo=FALSE, out.width='100%', fig.cap="Aggregated half-hourly average residuals for the ARIMAX model"}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(pFolder, "ARIMAX/allHousesResidual.pdf"))
```

The addition of the external regressor provides a very slight increase of accuracy during peak periods compared to the ARIMA model, with an increase in RMSE of `r round(DFsummary$pcErrorIncrease[DFsummary$model == "ARIMAX"], 2)`%.

## ARIMA with STL decomposition

Our STL + ARIMA model had RMSEs ranging between `r round(min(dfSummary$RMSE[dfSummary$model == "STLARIMA"]), 2)`W and `r round(max(dfSummary$RMSE[dfSummary$model == "STLARIMA"]), 2)`W, with the average being `r round(DFsummary$RMSE[DFsummary$model == "STLARIMA"], 2)`W.

During peak periods, RMSEs ranged between `r round(min(dfSummary$peakRMSE[dfSummary$model == "STLARIMA"]), 2)`W and `r round(max(dfSummary$peakRMSE[dfSummary$model == "STLARIMA"]), 2)`W, with the average being `r round(DFsummary$peakRMSE[DFsummary$model == "STLARIMA"], 2)`W.

It performs slightly worse than the standard ARIMA model for physical fidelity. Although more instances where the initial instance of the element turning on is predicted, it is also more likely to return negative values or values above that capable of the element. It therefore scores low for physical fidelity. 
This model is understandable as the sum of the seasonal and trend components, with an ARIMA modelled remainder. Parameters for all these elements are available, giving a general understanding of underlying patterns in the data, however it is somewhat convoluted. Interpretability therefore scores low to moderate. 
The computational time to fit models to each household varied between `r round(min(dfSummary$fittingTime[dfSummary$model == "STLARIMA"]), 2)`s and `r round(max(dfSummary$fittingTime[dfSummary$model == "STLARIMA"]), 2)`s, with the average taking `r round(DFsummary$fittingTime[DFsummary$model == "STLARIMA"], 2)`s.

```{r STLARIMAplot, echo=FALSE, out.width='100%', fig.cap="Performance of STL + ARIMA model for four households over four separate days"}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(pFolder, "STLARIMA/fourHouses.pdf"))
```

```{r STLARIMAresiduals, echo=FALSE, out.width='100%', fig.cap="Aggregated half-hourly average residuals for the STLARIMA model"}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(pFolder, "STLARIMA/allHousesResidual.pdf"))
```

While still losing accuracy during peak periods, with a RMSE increase of `r round(DFsummary$pcErrorIncrease[DFsummary$model == "STLARIMA"], 2)`%, this model had the lowest percentage increase in peak period RMSEs of all those considered in this analysis.

## ARIMAX with STL decomposition

Our STL + ARIMAX model had RMSEs ranging between `r round(min(dfSummary$RMSE[dfSummary$model == "STLARIMAX"]), 2)`W and `r round(max(dfSummary$RMSE[dfSummary$model == "STLARIMAX"]), 2)`W, with the average being `r round(DFsummary$RMSE[DFsummary$model == "STLARIMAX"], 2)`W.

During peak periods, RMSEs ranged between `r round(min(dfSummary$peakRMSE[dfSummary$model == "STLARIMAX"]), 2)`W and `r round(max(dfSummary$peakRMSE[dfSummary$model == "STLARIMAX"]), 2)`W, with the average being `r round(DFsummary$peakRMSE[DFsummary$model == "STLARIMAX"], 2)`W.

This model essentially performs the same as the ARIMA + STL model for physical fidelity. Although more instances where the initial instance of the element turning on is predicted, it is also more likely to return negative values or values above that capable of the element. It therefore scores low for physical fidelity. 
This model is understandable as the sum of the seasonal and trend components, with an ARIMA modelled remainder. Parameters for all these elements are available, giving a general understanding of underlying patterns in the data, however it is somewhat convoluted. Interpretability therefore scores low to moderate. 
The computational time to fit models to each household varied between `r round(min(dfSummary$fittingTime[dfSummary$model == "STLARIMAX"]), 2)`s and `r round(max(dfSummary$fittingTime[dfSummary$model == "STLARIMAX"]), 2)`s, with the average taking `r round(DFsummary$fittingTime[DFsummary$model == "STLARIMAX"], 2)`s.
```{r STLARIMAXplot, echo=FALSE, out.width='100%', fig.cap="Performance of STL + ARIMAX model for four households over four separate days"}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(pFolder, "/STLARIMAX/fourHouses.pdf"))
```

```{r STLARIMAXresiduals, echo=FALSE, out.width='100%', fig.cap="Aggregated half-hourly average residuals for the STLARIMAX model"}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(pFolder, "STLARIMAX/allHousesResidual.pdf"))
```

This method had a peak period RMSE increase of `r round(DFsummary$pcErrorIncrease[DFsummary$model == "STLARIMAX"], 2)`%, which, interestingly, is slightly more than the same model without the external regressor.

## SVM model

The SVM model was the most accurate model considered, with RMSEs ranging between between `r round(min(dfSummary$RMSE[dfSummary$model == "SVM"]), 2)`W and `r round(max(dfSummary$RMSE[dfSummary$model == "SVM"]), 2)`W, with the average being `r round(DFsummary$RMSE[DFsummary$model == "SVM"], 2)`W.

During peak periods, RMSEs ranged between `r round(min(dfSummary$peakRMSE[dfSummary$model == "SVM"]), 2)`W and `r round(max(dfSummary$peakRMSE[dfSummary$model == "SVM"]), 2)`W, with the average being `r round(DFsummary$peakRMSE[DFsummary$model == "SVM"], 2)`W.

The model is slightly smoother than the actual data, and seldom displays negative values or values above what is capable of the element. It scores moderate to high for physical fidelity. 
This model is essentially "black box", providing very limited insight as to its selected parameters and their significance. As such, it scores low for interpretability. 

The computational time to fit models to each household was very high, varying between `r round(min(dfSummary$fittingTime[dfSummary$model == "SVM"]), 2)`s and `r round(max(dfSummary$fittingTime[dfSummary$model == "SVM"]), 2)`s, with the average taking `r round(DFsummary$fittingTime[DFsummary$model == "SVM"], 2)`s. 

```{r SVMplot, echo=FALSE, out.width='100%', fig.cap="Performance of SVM model for four households over four separate days"}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(pFolder, "/SVM/fourHouses.pdf"))
```

```{r SVMresiduals, echo=FALSE, out.width='100%', fig.cap="Aggregated half-hourly average residuals for the SVM model"}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(pFolder, "SVM/allHousesResidual.pdf"))
```

Examination of the aggregated daily average residuals shows that this model had the highest increase in peak period RMSEs of `r round(DFsummary$pcErrorIncrease[DFsummary$model == "SVM"], 2)`%.
