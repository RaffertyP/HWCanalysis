################## TO DO ##################

General:
Fix title page 
- include logo etc
- no need to 'approve for division'
- no preface necessary
Fix plots so it prints ok
Include nomenclature at beginning (after list of tables?)

Intro:
Elaborate on why the metrics were chosen

Lit review:
Expand on demand forecasting
How good are the existing models and what are they used for?
With existing research in mind, why is mine worthwhile?
MJ not sure about point of last two paragraphs in Sec 2.1

Methodology:
Create illustrative examples to justify increase of model complexity
Introduce residual analysis
Make a flow chart of data processing sequence
Draw family tree/landscape of models, indicate if they have been used for elec data and which I have decided to use
Elaborate on the process of sorting through existing work to choose the models I have chosen
Fig 3.5: Elec demand of hw and other app over one day - change colour to b/w with dashed lines

Results:
Make sure boxplot caption is displayed

Discussion:
Address energy efficiency and fidelity of HWC simulations
Tie different models to literature
include plots/averages/twodayXX.png to show why seasonalnaive no good
bring back to 'so what'

Possible (low priority):
Combine the metrics "interpretability" and "physical fidelity" into one metric called "suitability for demand simulations" or similar
Look at variance etc of dfSummary
modelling.R would be better separated into individual functions that are called on as opposed to one huge page worth
Add other elec (dotted line) to linear model plot
Clone github repository and rerun to check reproducibility
