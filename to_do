################## TO DO ##################

Complete results chapter
Expand upon forecasting lit in lit review
Include nomenclature at beginning (after list of tables?)
Draw family tree/landscape of models, indicate if they have been used for elec data and which I have decided to use
Elaborate on the process of sorting through existing work to choose the models I have chosen
Interest over time in data science methods is too specific; show broader interest. The specific methods may be able to be used in a different section
Look at variance etc of DFsummary
Make weekly profile plot
Make plot demonstrating other elec turning on before HW elec
Add other elec (dotted line) to linear model plot
Redo ccv plot
Clone github repository and rerun to check reproducibility
Become familiar with Kalman filter
Explain/reference frequency analysis/periodogram/stl
Tidy ARIMA.R
bats - SHOULD BE ABLE TO SPECIFY SEASONAL PERIODS
Try to plot weighting coefficients and pull out code of how VAR model gets them
so we may use this for our GAM model
