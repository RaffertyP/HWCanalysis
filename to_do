################## TO DO ##################

Restructure data to have dummy variables
Make seasonality error reproducible, ask devs
Can try break using a sine function, no need to use our data
CREATE MODELS, GET RESULTS
bats - SHOULD BE ABLE TO SPECIFY SEASONAL PERIODS
Force seaonality using dummy variables
Plot from Linear using plot_model function
See what others have done with missing data
Discuss missing data in methodology
Make weekly profile plot
Add other elec (dotted line) to linear model plot
Redo ccv plot
Extract RSS from models, replace sd in body with RSS
Rewrite lit review under context of predictive models, not thermal models
Include electricity forecasting literature in lit review
Repeat steps of VAR model with ARIMA model for comparison
Look for patents/papers by Iv√°n Castro
Create GAM with 30 minute data
Become familiar with Kalman filter, logistic regression in R
Try to plot weighting coefficients and pull out code of how VAR model gets them
so we may use this for our GAM model
