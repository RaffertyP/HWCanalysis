################## TO DO ##################

Fix plots so it prints ok
Put data processing code in the appendix
Make a flow chart of data processing sequence
Improve smart control section 
Include international context in introduction
Some prelim analysis can be seperated into methodology/results
put combined acv plots in appendix
Include international context esp for demand response/elec grid
Tie different models in discussion to literature
Can then have two results chapters: prelim data analysis and modelling
Include nomenclature at beginning (after list of tables?)
Draw family tree/landscape of models, indicate if they have been used for elec data and which I have decided to use
Elaborate on the process of sorting through existing work to choose the models I have chosen
Look at variance etc of DFsummary
modelling.R may be better separated into individual functions that are called on as opposed to one huge page worth
Plot ACV of model residuals to check that seasonality is being accounted for
-Join individual plots with grid.arrange
Add other elec (dotted line) to linear model plot
Clone github repository and rerun to check reproducibility
Explain/reference frequency analysis/periodogram
