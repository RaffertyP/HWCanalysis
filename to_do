################## TO DO ##################

Expand upon forecasting lit in lit review
Complete results chapter
Rerun models with original data
Include nomenclature at beginning (after list of tables?)
Draw family tree/landscape of models, indicate if they have been used for elec data and which I have decided to use
Describe process of sorting through existing work to choose the models I have chosen
Interest over time in data science methods is too specific; show broader interest. The specific methods may be able to be used in a different section
Split project into folders "data", "scripts", "report" etc (remove reference to Masters)
Adjust filepaths in filepaths.R accordingly and source this file (rather than state filepaths each time)
Look at variance etc of DFsummary
Try to plot weighting coefficients and pull out code of how VAR model gets them
so we may use this for our GAM model
Can try break using a sine function, no need to use our data
bats - SHOULD BE ABLE TO SPECIFY SEASONAL PERIODS
Discuss missing data in methodology (probably only necessary if cleaned data used)
Make weekly profile plot
Add other elec (dotted line) to linear model plot
Redo ccv plot
Look for patents/papers by Iv√°n Castro
Become familiar with Kalman filter
Explain/reference frequency analysis/periodogram/stl
