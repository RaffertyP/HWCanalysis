METHODOLOGY (to give to Michael Wed 2nd)
-Provide context

Check for and remove anomolies with HWC data (all houses)

rewrite lit review under context of predictive models, not thermal models
include electricity forecasting literature in lit review

repeat steps of VAR model with ARIMA model for comparison

Look for patents/papers by Iv√°n Castro

Create GAM with 30 minute data

become familiar with Kalman filter, logistic regression in R

try to plot weighting coefficients and pull out code of how VAR model gets them
so we may use this for our GAM model

run model with heat pump hot water and compare
