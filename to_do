################## TO DO ##################

General:
Answer the question: how much extra could be obtained for DR using this system?
Fix title page 
- include logo etc
- no need to 'approve for division'
- no preface necessasry
Fix plots so it prints ok
Include nomenclature at beginning (after list of tables?)
Make sure every chapter has an intro and summary
- where are we up to? 
- where are we going next?

Intro: 
Mention other countries eg SA 

Lit review:
Expand on demand forecasting
How good are the existing models and what are they used for?
With existing research in mind, why is mine worthwhile?

Methodology:
Create illustrative examples to justify increase of model complexity
Introduce residual analysis
Make a flow chart of data processing sequence
Draw family tree/landscape of models, indicate if they have been used for elec data and which I have decided to use
Elaborate on the process of sorting through existing work to choose the models I have chosen

Results:
Get to the bottom of the SARIMA failure
Make sure boxplot caption is displayed
Include residual analysis
-Plot ACV of model residuals to check that seasonality is being accounted for
-Join individual plots with grid.arrange

Discussion:
Estimate potential benefits to NZ
-Use article that ascertains how many cylinders nec for X MW
-Use this to make estimate of value for each DR market
Tie different models to literature
Discuss aggregation
include plots/averages/twodayXX.png to show why seasonalnaive no good
Provide overview of the how the results of this research can be incorporated into a SC system

Appendix:
Include code (data processing and modelling)
Include combined ACV plots

Possible (low priority):
Remove references to causal modelling. Just call them regression models
Combine the metrics "interpretability" and "physical fidelity" into one metric called "suitability for demand simulations" or similar
Look at variance etc of dfSummary
modelling.R would be better separated into individual functions that are called on as opposed to one huge page worth
Add other elec (dotted line) to linear model plot
Clone github repository and rerun to check reproducibility
