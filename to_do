################## TO DO ##################

Look at variance etc of DFsummary
Create GAM with 30 minute data
Try to plot weighting coefficients and pull out code of how VAR model gets them
so we may use this for our GAM model
Can try break using a sine function, no need to use our data
bats - SHOULD BE ABLE TO SPECIFY SEASONAL PERIODS
See what others have done with missing data
Discuss missing data in methodology
Make weekly profile plot
Add other elec (dotted line) to linear model plot
Redo ccv plot
Rejig lit review under context of predictive models, not thermal models
Include electricity forecasting literature in lit review
Look for patents/papers by Iv√°n Castro
Become familiar with Kalman filter
Explain/reference frequency analysis/periodogram/stl
