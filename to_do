################## TO DO ##################

Section 1.1 (Demand Side Mangement) needs "bigger picture" why peaks matter, costs etc. Include references.

Create methodology - this needs to outline time series theory including our metrics and data cleaning

Each chapter needs to introduce exactly what is happening in the chapter.

Preliminary analysis - name of chapter with ccv, acv etc. Include individual houses as well as aggregate. 
Mention where and why the preliminary analysis links to the methods.

Pick a start date in the data and cut everthing before it. Use Bens analysis to inform.

Check for and remove anomolies with HWC data (all houses)

Look for patents/papers by Iv√°n Castro

Write theory

Decouple - thesis from code
	 - blocks of code from one another
	 - thesis from reproducible research output 

rewrite lit review under context of predictive models, not thermal models
include electricity forecasting literature in lit review

repeat steps of VAR model with ARIMA model for comparison

Create GAM with 30 minute data

become familiar with Kalman filter, logistic regression in R

double-check average plot (looks 12 hours wrong)

try to plot weighting coefficients and pull out code of how VAR model gets them
so we may use this for our GAM model

run model with heat pump hot water and compare

Explain/reference frequency analysis/periodogram/stl
