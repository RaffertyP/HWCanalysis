################## TO DO ##################

Check for and remove anomolies with HWC data (all houses)

Look for patents/papers by Iv√°n Castro

Add methodology including a naive model as benchmark

Write theory

Decouple - thesis from code
	 - blocks of code from one another
	 - thesis from reproducible research output 

rewrite lit review under context of predictive models, not thermal models
include electricity forecasting literature in lit review

repeat steps of VAR model with ARIMA model for comparison

Create GAM with 30 minute data

become familiar with Kalman filter, logistic regression in R

double-check average plot (looks 12 hours wrong)

try to plot weighting coefficients and pull out code of how VAR model gets them
so we may use this for our GAM model

run model with heat pump hot water and compare

Explain/reference frequency analysis/periodogram/stl

Make reproducable (get data straight from source and clean)

Investigate LSTM for electricity data analysis
