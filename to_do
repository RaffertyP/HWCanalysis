Fix plots so it prints ok
Provide references in conventional and AI forecasting sections in introduction
Make sure electricity grid section in Intro mentions:
Generation, Transmission, Distribution, Consumption, Deregulated market etc
Put data processing code in the appendix
Change "naive" model to "simple naive"
Make a flow chart of data processing sequence
put combined acv plots in appendix
Include international context in intro esp for demand response/elec grid
Tie different models in discussion to literature
Include nomenclature at beginning (after list of tables?)
Draw family tree/landscape of models, indicate if they have been used for elec data and which I have decided to use
Elaborate on the process of sorting through existing work to choose the models I have chosen
Look at variance etc of DFsummary
modelling.R may be better separated into individual functions that are called on as opposed to one huge page worth
Plot ACV of model residuals to check that seasonality is being accounted for
-Join individual plots with grid.arrange
Add other elec (dotted line) to linear model plot
Clone github repository and rerun to check reproducibility
Explain/reference frequency analysis/periodogram
