################## TO DO ##################

Include Italian ARIMAX article in lit rev
Fix plots so it prints ok
Change fitting speed to include validating
-Have fitting and validating separate, then take the total
Elaborate on ARIMAX/STL + ARIMAX in methodology
Complete results chapter
-Seasonal naive
-ARIMAX
-STL+ARIMAX
Work on residuals:
-Quantify value during peaks
Some prelim analysis can be seperated into methodology/results
Can then have two results chapters: prelim data analysis and modelling
Include nomenclature at beginning (after list of tables?)
Draw family tree/landscape of models, indicate if they have been used for elec data and which I have decided to use
Elaborate on the process of sorting through existing work to choose the models I have chosen
Look at variance etc of DFsummary
modelling.R may be better separated into individual functions that are called on as opposed to one huge page worth
Plot ACV of model residuals to check that seasonality is being accounted for
-Join individual plots with grid.arrange
Add other elec (dotted line) to linear model plot
Redo ccv plot
Clone github repository and rerun to check reproducibility
Explain/reference frequency analysis/periodogram
Try to plot weighting coefficients and pull out code of how VAR model gets them so we may use this for a GAM model
