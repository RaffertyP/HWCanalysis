################## TO DO ##################

General:
Fix plots so it prints ok
Include nomenclature at beginning (after list of tables?)
Make sure every chapter has an intro and summary
- where are we up to? 
- where are we going next?

Intro:
Mention other countries (eg SA)
Provide references in conventional and AI forecasting sections 
Make sure electricity grid section covers Generation, Transmission, Distribution, Consumption, Deregulated market

Lit review:
Make clear the reasoning behind starting with simple models and building complexity
Expand on demand forecasting
How good are the existing models and what are they used for?
With existing research in mind, why is mine worthwhile?
Provide intro to difference between simulation and forecast

Methodology:
Create illustrative examples to justify increase of model complexity
Introduce residual analysis
Make a flow chart of data processing sequence
Draw family tree/landscape of models, indicate if they have been used for elec data and which I have decided to use
Elaborate on the process of sorting through existing work to choose the models I have chosen

Results:
Include residual analysis
-Plot ACV of model residuals to check that seasonality is being accounted for
-Join individual plots with grid.arrange

Discussion:
Tie different models to literature

Appendix:
Include code (data processing and modelling)
Include combined ACV plots

Possible (low priority):
Remove references to causal modelling. Just call them regression models
Combine the metrics "interpretability" and "physical fidelity" into one metric called "suitability for demand simulations" or similar
Look at variance etc of dfSummary
modelling.R would be better separated into individual functions that are called on as opposed to one huge page worth
Add other elec (dotted line) to linear model plot
Clone github repository and rerun to check reproducibility
