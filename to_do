################## TO DO ##################

Include nomenclature at beginning (after list of tables?)
Split preliminary data analysis into Methodology and Results
Draw Demand side management/Data science ven diagram, indicate the catagories which overlap
Draw family tree/landscape of models, indicate if they have been used for elec data and which I have decided to use
Revert data to messy form, run models again, include results (systematically)
Complete SVM analysis
Move AI stuff to methodology

Currently reads like somebody chose the methods and I used them. Need to clarify how I decided what models to use (i.e. need to make clear WHY SVM is better than NN for this data). This could be in lit review or may need it's own chapter
Split aims into two: (i) determine what methods to use, and (ii) apply them to obtain results as accurate as possible
Describe process of sorting through existing work to choose the models I have chosen
Put one minute analysis as 'further work'
Include 'problem description' in introduction, perhaps by elaborating in DSM section
Describe what has been done already in this field, then how we are going to improve on this with data science methods
Interest over time in data science methods is too specific; show broader interest. The specific methods may be able to be used in a different section
Elaborate on why specific methods are used and why some are not
Don't include methodology in results
Describe TSA before models



WRITE UP ALL MODELS CONSIDERED SO FAR
COMPLETE FORECASTING SECTION OF LIT REVIEW

Look at variance etc of DFsummary
Create GAM with 30 minute data
Try to plot weighting coefficients and pull out code of how VAR model gets them
so we may use this for our GAM model
Can try break using a sine function, no need to use our data
bats - SHOULD BE ABLE TO SPECIFY SEASONAL PERIODS
See what others have done with missing data
Discuss missing data in methodology
Make weekly profile plot
Add other elec (dotted line) to linear model plot
Redo ccv plot
Rejig lit review under context of predictive models, not thermal models
Include electricity forecasting literature in lit review
Look for patents/papers by Iv√°n Castro
Become familiar with Kalman filter
Explain/reference frequency analysis/periodogram/stl
